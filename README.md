# OpenFoam_related
in this repo I develop codes related to postprocessing and data visualizations of OPENFOAM.

# make DataFram abd Plot
this code reads velocity data from postProcessing directory and plot them.
obviusly it would be useful plotting any veraiable in such way.
NOte: theses type of data storage could be used easily in ML projects
